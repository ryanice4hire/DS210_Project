# DS210_Project
Welcome! 
This is my final project for DS210. In the src folder you will find the dataset that I used to do this project (ds_salaries.csv), the main.rs file 
that I wrote to do the project, and the final project report titled Data Science Final Project Report.pdf. In the main function of 
main.rs I already printed out the results that I was looking for, but you are welcome to do your own analysis with my program. At the top of every function 
I added a commented on how to use the function and what it does. If you're curious about what jobs there are and what salary ranges exist, the 
salary ranges are defined in the graph() function and the jobs you can find from printing out the graphs. Again, **I ALREADY PRINTED OUT THE RESULTS 
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING**
